            SEPT 2015 – PRESENT TECHONOLOGY DESIGN ENGINEER, ARUP I have worked predominantly on Smart Motorway Projects (J23a-25 and J13-16) as an Intelligent Transport Systems Design Engineer, with tasks involving but not limited to: * The day to day utilization of research, testing, logic and problem solving. * Overseeing a small team consisting of another engineer, a technician and an apprentice, to consistently meet high intensity, high pressure deadlines. * Working with people from other disciplines, academic backgrounds and time zones to succinctly solve complex new problems and then communicating these solutions to the wider team. * Collating and manipulating large quantities of data. * Designing intricate and isolated technology systems (e.g. CCTV and RADAR), that fit into the larger overall project. * Giving presentations to Senior staff members on new ideas, innovations and solutions. * Pre-empting possible project problems and designing them out, or creating and circulating contingency plans.

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>
            2010-2014 ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, UNIVERSITY OF KENT My dissertation was on 'The Biometric Identification of Wildlife' with a focus on Zebras. I designed an application using C++ that scanned the 'Region of Interest' of each Zebra image, like a thumb print, reducing it to a binary format and scanning the remaining image. This data was then cross-referenced with an open source data base of 826 zebras, to approximate an identity match. I received a high 2:1 BEng (Hons). Programming languages and software used during the course include: C++, C, Matlab, HTML, PHP, CSS, Visual Basic, Arduino, Labview, VHDL.
